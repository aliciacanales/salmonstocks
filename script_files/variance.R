## Use Tamma and Nathan's overleaf as a guide for estimating variance


## Utility function - people get utility from salmon returns u(s)

## society's utility function:
## u(s) = r(s) -y*v(s) ## utility = metapopulation mean - how much we tolerate risk * metapopulation variance

## Variance is a maximization problem, can use the function: optim() 
# will be made up of three equations
# 1) s_fun to get s(w), which is s_invest or s after investment
# 2) risk tolerance variable (y)
# 3) variance equation (this may need to be broken up into multiple steps)
