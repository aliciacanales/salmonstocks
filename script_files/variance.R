## Use Nathan and Tamma's overleaf as a guide for estimating variance


## Utility function - people get utility from salmon returns u(s)

## society's utility function:
## u(s) = r(s) -y*v(s) ## utility = metapopulation mean - how much we tolerate risk * metapopulation variance

## Variance is a maximization problem, can use the function: optim() (verify this)

# will be made up of three (maybe 4) equations
# 1) output of s_fun (s_fun to get s(w), which is s_invest or s after investment)
# 2) variance (diagonal from variance-covariance martix)
# 3) covariance equation (this may need to be broken up into two steps for i and j

## One overall equation bringing together the 3 equations above and adding risk tolerance variable (y)
